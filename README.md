I have tagged and described my repo's to help you navigate, but even better, I have made a list below of the projects I want you to see below.

## My Portfolio Projects (so far):

Botanicals Design ([repo](https://github.com/botanicals/botanicalsdesign), [live](https://botanicalsdesign.netlify.app/))

MrsDurrant.com ([repo](), [live]()) (built with only HTML & Sass)

Avarice Sheets ([repo](https://github.com/avaricegame/avarice-sheets), [live](https://avarice-sheets.netlify.app/)) (redux-saga and backend implementation currently in progress, so there may be a few bugs depending on when you are looking at this)

AvariceGame.com ([repo](https://github.com/avaricegame/avarice-website), [live](https://avarice-website.vercel.app/)) (just getting started with this one, so it isn't that impressive or done yet)
