# Talon Durrant - Portfolio (talondurrant.com)

I have tagged and described my repo's to help you navigate, but even better, I have made a list below of the projects I want you to see below.

I emphasize in Full Stack JavaScript, and focus most of my projects on React & Node/Express.

## My Portfolio Projects (so far):

Botanicals Design ([repo](https://github.com/botanicals/botanicalsdesign), [live](https://botanicalsdesign.com/))

Avarice Sheets ([repo](https://github.com/avaricegame/avarice-sheets), [live](https://sheets.avaricegame.com/)) (I am ALWAYS working on this because it is so large -- but the most current functional version is always the one deployed.)

Avarice Sheets API ([repo](https://github.com/avaricegame/avarice-sheets-api))

## What am I currently working on?

I am currently working on getting a firm grasp of AWS, Docker + Kubernetes, and React Native. In addition, my projects I am working on are Avarice Sheets (already listed above), and AvariceGame.com, which is in the very beginnings of development with NextJS.

AvariceGame.com ([repo](https://github.com/avaricegame/avarice-website), [live](https://avarice-website.netlify.app/)) (just getting started with this one, so it isn't that impressive or done yet)

## Some Other Projects That I Like

MrsDurrant.com ([repo](https://github.com/talonmd/mrs-durrant), [live](https://mrsdurrant.com/)) (built with only HTML & Sass)

## Some Projects I have Completed as Part of Courses

**I do not claim this work as my own, but have them listed here to give you an idea of what types of projects I have worked on, and the principles I have learned from completing these course projects**
