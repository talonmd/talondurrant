                    <p>
                       Since my first class on how to use HTML, I have been hooked on development. Since then I have worked tirelessly on teaching myself development and problem solving skills, and making myself the best developer I can be. This passion has translated into me earning a degree at UVU in Web Design and Development, and that, along with my self-taught courses, has made me ready to enter the workforce as a Full Stack Software Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the earning of my A.A.S. in Web Design and Development, I gained a solid understanding of UX/UI Design Principles, and how to create user-focused designs. Through this process I taught myself development, with a focus in React, Node, Express, and non-relational databases (MongoDB), and the frameworks, libraries, and ecosystems that come along with those. I have a deep understanding of deployment and develoment with Docker, Kubernetes, and the use of Microservices.

                        <p>A web application running on React that utilizes a Node/Express server and MongoDB databse. This app allows users to register, sign in, and create their own character and campaign sheets for Abberations in Avarice, a role-playing game similar to Dungeons and Dragons. These character and campaign sheets are interactive and allow the user to perfrom all CRUD actions on the database. It makes use of NPM Packages such as Axios and Immer, and is built using React hooks and features such as Reducer and Context.</p>
                        <p>More features are continuously being built and added to complete this large project. In the future, features will be implemented to open live socket connections to allow instant messaging and sessions to be in use.</p>
